# Privacy Sandbox - ML Inference in Bidding and Auction Services

This directory contains the implementation of the inference sidecar, designed to execute ML
inference with the bidding server.

For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the
[Inference Overview](https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-services-docs/blob/main/inference_overview.md).

## Status

Experimental. A special build flag is required for Docker image creation.

-   Platform: Currrently supports GCP. AWS support is in progress.
-   ML Frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch are supported.

### Models Supported by B&A Inference

There are currently limitations on the size of the model supported by the inference sidecar. The
maximum size of ML models supported is 2GB due to the protocol buffer size limit.

## Build the B&A Inference Docker Image

As current setting in our build favor, we will by default include inference packaging.

Use the `production/packaging/build_and_test_all_in_docker` script to build and push Docker images

of B&A to your GCP image repo, for AWS you will need to manually add to the terrorform config file
after build. If you want to enforce rebuild all sidecar binary, please set
`--rebuild-inference-sidecar`, otherwise script will skip build exist binary.

By default we will packaging all models(tensorflow_v2_14_0 and pytorch_v2_1_1) binary in the built
image. You can congfig to target specific model by change .bazelrc files's `--//:inference_runtime`
to "tensorflow"/"pytorch".

To disable Inference packaging Build: change .bazelrc files's `--//:inference_build` to "no".

## Cloud Deployment

### Start the B&A servers in GCP

-   Create a GCS bucket and store ML models into it.
-   The GCS bucket needs to give the service account associated with the GCE instance both storage
    legacy bucket reader and storage legacy object reader permissions:
    [guide on setting bucket permissions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).
-   Now you need to deploy a B&A server stack:
    [deployment guide](https://github.com/privacysandbox/bidding-auction-servers/tree/main/production/deploy/gcp/terraform/environment/demo/README.md).
-   In the B&A deployment terraform configuration, set runtime flags:

    -   Set `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_BINARY_PATH` to `/server/bin/inference_sidecar_<module_name>` for GCP
        platform. the suffix module name support currently are `pytorch_v2_1_1` and
        `tensorflow_v2_14_0`.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_BUCKET_NAME` to the name of the GCS bucket that you have created. Note
        that this _not_ a url. For example, the bucket name can be "test_models".
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` flag to the path to the model configuration file relative
        to the model cloud bucket. This metadata file lists models to be fetched.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_FETCH_PERIOD_MS` to the period that the bidding server checks updates
        in the model configuration file and fetches models.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_RUNTIME_CONFIG` which has the following format:

        ```javascript
        {
            "num_interop_threads": <integer_value>,
            "num_intraop_threads": <integer_value>,
            "module_name": <string_value>,
            "cpuset": <an array of integer values>,
            "tcmalloc_release_bytes_per_sec": <integer_value>,
            "tcmalloc_max_total_thread_cache_bytes": <integer_value>,
            "tcmalloc_max_per_cpu_cache_bytes": <integer_value>
        }
        ```

        `module_name` flag is required and should be one of "test", "tensorflow_v2_14_0", or
        "pytorch_v2_1_1". All other flags are optional.

### Start the B&A servers in AWS

-   Create a S3 bucket and store ML models into it.
-   Grant Access to your new S3 Bucket to Bidding instance. Perfer to using terraform config:
    example as:

    ```javascript
    resource "aws_iam_policy" "instance_policy" {
       ...
       statement {
           actions = [
               "s3:ListBucket",
               "s3:GetBucketLocation",
               "s3:GetObject",
           ]
       effect    = "Allow"
       resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>"]
       }
    }
    ```

-   In the B&A deployment terraform configuration, set runtime flags:

    -   Set `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_BINARY_PATH` to `/server/bin/inference_sidecar_<module_name>` for AWS
        platform. the suffix module name support currently are `pytorch_v2_1_1` and
        `tensorflow_v2_14_0`.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_BUCKET_NAME` to the name of the S3 bucket that you have created. Note
        that this _not_ a url. For example, the bucket name can be "test_models".
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` flag to the path to the model configuration file relative
        to the model cloud bucket. This metadata file lists models to be fetched.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_MODEL_FETCH_PERIOD_MS` to the period that the bidding server checks updates
        in the model configuration file and fetches models.
    -   Set `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_RUNTIME_CONFIG` which has the following format:

        ```javascript
        {
            "num_interop_threads": <integer_value>,
            "num_intraop_threads": <integer_value>,
            "module_name": <string_value>,
            "cpuset": <an array of integer values>,
            "tcmalloc_release_bytes_per_sec": <integer_value>,
            "tcmalloc_max_total_thread_cache_bytes": <integer_value>,
            "tcmalloc_max_per_cpu_cache_bytes": <integer_value>
        }
        ```

        `module_name` flag is required and should be one of "test", "tensorflow_v2_14_0", or
        "pytorch_v2_1_1". All other flags are optional.

### Note on AWS B&A deployment with static model loading

-   When using static model loading on AWS, the loading time directly correlates with the file size
    in the S3 bucket. If loading times are prolonged, increasing the Terraform configuration value
    `healthcheck_grace_period_sec` may be necessary to allow the model to fully load. Without this
    adjustment, the instance may be rebooted by autoscaling.
-   Currently we set `healthcheck_grace_period_sec` to 180s. Buyer module take 120s+ for bidding
    initialization with loading 9 Gib model bucket.

### Note on B&A deployment without inference

-   In either GCP or AWS terraform config, inference is only enabled when
    `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_BINARY_PATH` is set.
-   When inference is not enabled, invocations of inference callbacks in UDF (e.g.,
    `runInference()`) will fail the UDF execution.

### Memory Protection for Inference

RAM Limitation

-   You can set the memory limit of the inference sidecar via `INFERENCE_SIDECAR_RLIMIT_MB`runtime
    flag. the value suggested to be set at least `12` times for your loaded model size. For example
    if you have a `500 mb` model then set `inference_sidecar_rlimit_mb` to `6000 mb` or more will be
    recommended.
-   This limiation using [RLIMIT_AS](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prlimit.2.html) which
    affects calls to brk(2), mmap(2), and mremap(2), which fail with the error ENOMEM upon exceeding
    this limit. In addition, automatic stack expansion fails (and generates a SIGSEGV that kills the
    process if no alternate stack has been made available via sigaltstack(2)). As a result
    `will kills off the process holding sidecar if exceed`, but bidding main process will not be
    effected.

## Local Testing

### Start the B&A servers locally for testing/debugging

The servers run locally and the ML models are directly read from the local disk.

-   Use the command-line flags: `--inference_sidecar_binary_path` and
    `--inference_model_local_paths`, `--inference_sidecar_runtime_config`.
-   Utilize `tools/debug/start_bidding --enable_inference` script.

## Inference API

### Trigger ML inference in UDF

To invoke ML inference within generateBid() or any other UDF:

1.  Create a batchInferenceRequest object. For each model:

    -   Specify the `model_path` (where the model is located).
    -   Specify input `tensors` containing the data for the model.

2.  Serialize the batchInferenceRequest into a JSON string compatible with the inference API.

3.  Trigger inference.

    -   Call the runInference(json_string) function, passing your serialized request as the
        argument. This initiates the inference execution.

4.  Process results.
    -   Parse the inference output returned by `runInference()`.
    -   Extract the model predictions for your bid calculations.

Here's the UDF example code:

```javascript
function generateBid() {
    const batchInferenceRequest = {
        request: [
            {
                model_path: '/model/path',
                tensors: [
                    {
                        tensor_name: 'input',
                        data_type: 'INT32',
                        tensor_shape: [1, 1],
                        tensor_content: ['8'],
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
    };

    const jsonRequest = JSON.stringify(batchInferenceRequest);
    const inferenceResult = runInference(jsonRequest);

    // Implement parsing logic based on your model's output format.
    const bidValue = parseInferenceResult(inferenceResult);
    return { bid: bidValue };
}
```

### JSON request

A Batch Inference Request (called `request`in JSON API) is an array of single inference requests.
Each single inference request contains an obligatory `model_path` string field (the same path you
used to register the ML model), as well as `tensors` array field. Each input tensor has three
required fields: `data_type`, `tensor_shape` and `tensor_content`. Tensorflow additionally requires
`tensor_name` field which should match tensor's name in SavedModel.

`tensor_shape` is an array representing the shape of tensor. The order of entries indicates the
layout of the values in the tensor in-memory representation. The first entry is the outermost
dimension, which usually represents the input batch size. The last entry is the innermost dimension.
We support only dense tensors.

`tensor_content` holds the flattened representation of the tensor which can be reconstructed using
`tensor_shape`. Only the representation corresponding to `data_type` field can be set. The number of
elements in `tensor_content` should be equal to the product of tensor_shape elements, for example a
tensor of shape `[1, 4]` will expect a flat array or 4 elements (e.g. `["1", "2", "7", "4"]`), and
one with a shape `[2,3]` will expect a 6 element one.

Currently we support 6 tensor types (both in Tensorflow and PyTorch): double, float, int8, int16,
int32, int64.

All numbers in `tensor_content` MUST be in string format.

See an example of a Batch Inference Request in a JSON format with 2 models:

```json
{
    "request": [
        {
            "model_path": "my_bucket/models/pcvr/1/",
            "tensors": [
                {
                    "tensor_name": "feature1",
                    "data_type": "DOUBLE",
                    "tensor_shape": [2, 1],
                    "tensor_content": ["0.454920", "-0.25752"]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "model_path": "my_bucket/models/pctr/2/",
            "tensors": [
                {
                    "tensor_name": "feature1",
                    "data_type": "INT32",
                    "tensor_shape": [2, 1],
                    "tensor_content": ["5", "6"]
                },
                {
                    "tensor_name": "feature2",
                    "data_type": "FLOAT",
                    "tensor_shape": [2, 3],
                    "tensor_content": ["0.5", "0.6", "0.7", "0.8", "0.21", "-0.99"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The response for the above request would look like this :

```json
{
    "response": [
        {
            "model_path": "my_bucket/models/pcvr/1/",
            "tensors": [
                {
                    "tensor_name": "StatefulPartitionedCall:0",
                    "data_type": "FLOAT",
                    "tensor_shape": [2, 1],
                    "tensor_content": [0.11673324, 0.178222424]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "model_path": "my_bucket/models/pctr/2/",
            "tensors": [
                {
                    "tensor_name": "StatefulPartitionedCall:0",
                    "data_type": "FLOAT",
                    "tensor_shape": [2, 1],
                    "tensor_content": [0.342842, 0.23468234]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
